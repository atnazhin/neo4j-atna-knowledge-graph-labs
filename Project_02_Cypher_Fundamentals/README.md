# Project 2: Cypher Fundamentals â€” Querying, Creating, and Updating Graph Data

In this project, I explored the fundamentals of the **Cypher query language** in Neo4j.  
I learned how to **retrieve**, **filter**, **create**, **update**, and **delete** data in a graph database.  

This project builds upon *Project 1: Data Import*, extending my Neo4j skills from data modeling to querying and manipulating graph structures.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
By completing this project, I learned how to:

- Retrieve nodes and relationships using Cypher.
- Filter queries using the `WHERE` clause.
- Traverse the graph using pattern matching.
- Create new nodes and relationships.
- Update and merge existing data.
- Delete nodes and related edges.

## ðŸ§© Domain Model Used

The dataset used is Neo4jâ€™s **Movies database**, containing `Person` and `Movie` nodes.
