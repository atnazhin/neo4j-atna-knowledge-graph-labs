Hands-on projects and notes exploring Neo4j and knowledge graph data modelling.

# Project 1: Importing Data into Neo4j using the Data Importer

In this project, I explored how to use the **Neo4j Data Importer** to bring CSV data into a graph database and build connections between entities.  
The goal was to create a small graph that includes **Person** and **Movie** nodes linked by **ACTED_IN** relationships.

Through this exercise, I learned how to:
- Upload and map CSV files to node labels (`Person`, `Movie`)
- Define unique identifiers for nodes
- Map column data to properties
- Import and verify relationships (`ACTED_IN`) between nodes
- Validate the data using Cypher queries

By the end of this project, the Neo4j database contained:
- üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë `Person` nodes (from `persons.csv`)
- üé¨ `Movie` nodes (from `movies.csv`)
- üîó `ACTED_IN` relationships (from `acted_in.csv`)

| # | Project Title | Description |
|---|---------------|--------------|
| 1 | [Importing Nodes from CSV using Data Importer](./01_data_importer_basics/README.md) | Imported a CSV file into Neo4j, created the `Person` node label, and verified data using Cypher. |
|  | [Challenge: Global Earthquake‚ÄìTsunami Risk Graph](./01_data_importer_basics/README.md#-challenge-global-earthquake‚Äìtsunami-risk-graph) | Modeled and imported a real-world dataset to build `Earthquake`, `Location`, and `TsunamiRisk` nodes connected by `OCCURRED_IN` and `HAS_TSUNAMI_RISK` relationships. |
| 2 | [Project 2: Cypher Fundamentals](./Project_02_Cypher_Fundamentals/README.md) | Query, filter, create, update, and delete graph data using Cypher on the Movies dataset. |

This provides the foundation for modeling real-world networks in Neo4j and prepares for more complex relationship types.
## üñºÔ∏è Visual Results  

Below are the complete Neo4j visual results ‚Äî showing the full workflow from importing data, creating relationships, running Cypher queries, and visualizing the graphs for both the **Movie dataset** and the **Global Earthquake‚ÄìTsunami Risk Challenge**.
