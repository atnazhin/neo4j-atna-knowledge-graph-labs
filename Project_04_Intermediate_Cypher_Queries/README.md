# Project 04 – Intermediate Cypher Queries

This project explores intermediate-level Cypher features, including:
- Filtering queries  
- Controlling results  
- Graph traversal  
- Pipelining queries  
- Subqueries  
- Using parameters  


---

## 🎯 Objectives

Through this project, I practiced how to:

- Filter and refine Cypher queries using **WHERE** and **logical operators**  
- Control and shape query results with **ORDER BY**, **LIMIT**, and **RETURN** clauses  
- Perform **graph traversals** across multiple relationships and nodes  
- Use **pipelining queries** to process and aggregate data efficiently  
- Build **subqueries** for modular and reusable query logic  
- Use **parameters** in Cypher for safer, more flexible, and dynamic queries

## 🧠 Key Learnings

By completing this project, I learned how to:
- Write **more expressive Cypher queries** to extract insights from connected data.  
- Leverage **subqueries** to organize complex graph traversal logic.  
- Use **parameters** to improve query security and reusability.  
- Chain Cypher statements together to achieve **multi-step data retrieval** workflows.
